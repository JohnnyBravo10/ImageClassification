# Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Project

This repository contains the report, 'Report.pdf', and the code of the project realized by Federico Pellizzaro, Giovanni Zanin, and me for the CV&PR course attended in fall 2023.

You can find the training set and test set at the following links, respectively:

The code consists in four Jupyter Notebooks, each corresponding
to a subsection of Section 5. Additionally, two utility modules with the extension
'.py' are included, containing frequently used functions. Experiment results are
available in the 'Data.zip' as files with the extension .csv. The code is thoroughly commented,
providing a guide for understanding the meaning of code and data files.
